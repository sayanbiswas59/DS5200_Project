Abnormality Detection in Musculoskeletal Radiographs


# Introduction
Musculoskeletal conditions affect more than 1.7 billion people worldwide, and are the most common cause of severe, long-term pain and disability, with 30 million emergency department visits annually and increasing. The musculoskeletal abnormality detection task therefore becomes particularly critical and especially in areas where access to skilled radiologists is limited. MURA is one of the largest public radiographic image datasets available for this use. With our project we aim to classify the body part the X-ray belongs to and then diagnose whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal.
